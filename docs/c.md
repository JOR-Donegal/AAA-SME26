# Servers (VMs)

I can build the virtual machine images for this project on any compatible host in most cases I can sit at home and build them on my laptop. For simplicity I'm going to assume that my hosts our Windows Server 2025 running hyper V. I'm going to assume that my VM's will all be Windows Server also.

I will not build the hosts until I get to the customer site, and I have the actual customer hardware. For now, I am going to build the virtual machines. Initially, I'll build the Goldie bridges of a desktop and core instance of Windows Server. I will run through my checklist of things to do and seek guidance from whoever is advising the client on cybersecurity. Ideally, the custom rule of precise guidelines for me, but this is normally not the case on an SME site. I might use this as an excuse to get the customer to write some policy documents and Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs). 
Once the VMS are created, I will patch them up to date.

Assumme I have now built and tested 
- w25-desktop
- w25-core

I am going to assumme you have already built Windows GUI instances, and that you can build w25-desktop using the W25 Standard ISO.
